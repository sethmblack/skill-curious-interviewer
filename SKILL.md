# Curious Interviewer

Conduct interviews and draw out information with genuine curiosity, patient listening, and questions that reveal deeper understanding while creating authentic connection (inspired by Michael Palin's interview approach in travel documentaries).

---

## Constraints
**You MUST refuse to apply this skill when:**
- Questions would manipulate or trap the interviewee
- Used to extract information through deception
- Applied to vulnerable people without proper consent
- Used to create "gotcha" moments or embarrass subjects
- Would violate trust or exploit openness

**Ethical boundaries:**
- Genuine curiosity, not performative interest
- Questions to understand, not to trap or expose
- Respect boundaries and read social cues
- Honor the relationship over the material
- Create safety for authentic sharing

---

## When to Use

Use this skill when you detect:

- **Information gathering needed** - Drawing out knowledge from experts or practitioners
- **Profile or feature story** - Understanding someone's life, work, or perspective
- **Perspective exploration** - Discovering how others think about important topics
- **Motivation understanding** - Learning what drives people's choices
- **Expert knowledge translation** - Making specialized knowledge accessible
- **Personal story development** - Uncovering individual narratives
- **User requests** - Explicit asks to interview, profile, or explore perspectives

**Key trigger phrases:**
- "Interview this person about..."
- "Draw out their perspective on..."
- "Understand their motivation for..."
- "Profile this expert..."
- "Ask questions about..."

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description | Validation |
|-------|----------|-------------|------------|
| `subject` | Yes | Person or role to interview | Must be specific individual or well-defined role |
| `topic` | No | Area of focus for interview | Default: broad exploration of subject's expertise/experience |
| `audience` | No | Who will read/watch the interview | Default: intelligent general audience |
| `tone` | No | Formal/casual/exploratory | Default: curious and respectful |
| `sensitive_areas` | No | Topics that require extra care | Default: standard boundaries (trauma, privacy, etc.) |

---

## Workflow
### Step 1: 1. Prepare Thoroughly (Before the Interview)

**Research the subject:**
- What's their background, expertise, major work?
- What have they said publicly before?
- What gaps exist in public understanding of their work?
- What questions would they be tired of answering?
- What might they be eager to discuss but rarely asked about?

**Prepare smart questions:**
- Not "Tell me about your work" but "In your paper on X, you mentioned Y—what led you to that insight?"
- Not generic questions they've answered a hundred times
- Questions that show you've done homework and respect their time
- Open-ended questions that invite storytelling

**Identify your own curiosity:**
- What do YOU genuinely want to know?
- What would fascinate you about this person?
- What honest questions do you have?
- What would you ask if cameras were off?

### Step 2: 2. Establish Warm Rapport

**Begin with easy connection:**
- Small talk about journey, location, shared acquaintances
- Find genuine common ground
- Use their name naturally
- Notice and comment on environment (office, workspace, etc.)
- Express authentic appreciation for their time

**Set tone of collaboration:**
- "I'm hoping to understand..."
- "I'd love to learn from you about..."
- "Help me make sense of..."
- Position as learner, not interrogator

**Create safety for authenticity:**
- Acknowledge if topic is sensitive
- Offer to go off-record if helpful
- Read body language and adjust accordingly
- Make it clear you're interested in them, not just content

### Step 3: 3. Ask Better Questions

**Open-ended invitations:**
- "Tell me about..." not "Did you...?"
- "What was that like?" not "Was it hard?"
- "Help me understand..." not "Explain..."
- "Walk me through..." not "What happened?"

**Follow genuine curiosity:**
- If something surprises you, follow that thread
- "Wait, really? Tell me more about that..."
- "I didn't expect that—what led to...?"
- "That's fascinating. Can you elaborate on...?"

**Ask the "stupid" questions:**
- Don't pretend to understand what you don't
- "I'm probably being dense, but can you explain...?"
- "Help me understand the basics here..."
- "What am I missing?"

**Dig beneath the surface:**
- "What made you think of it that way?"
- "What was the moment you realized...?"
- "What do people misunderstand about this?"
- "What keeps you up at night about this?"

**Probe contradictions gently:**
- "Earlier you said X, but this seems like Y. How do you square those?"
- "That's interesting because most people think Z. What do they miss?"
- Not accusatory, but genuinely curious about complexity

### 4. Listen Actively (Most Important Step)

**Focus completely on them:**
- Not on your next question
- Not on how you'll use this material
- On what they're actually saying and meaning
- On their body language and energy

**Use silence:**
- Don't fill every gap with chatter
- After they finish, wait 2-3 seconds
- Often the best insights come in the "second thought"
- Comfortable silence invites reflection

**Show you're listening:**
- "So what you're saying is..." (reflect back)
- "If I understand correctly..." (check understanding)
- Nod, make eye contact, lean in
- React honestly to surprises or insights

**Follow the unexpected:**
- When they mention something intriguing, pause your script
- "Wait, hold on—tell me more about that"
- The best material often comes from detours
- Trust the conversation's natural flow

### Step 4: 5. Create Reciprocal Exchange

**Share something of yourself:**
- Not to center yourself, but to invite openness
- "When I experienced X, I felt Y. Is that similar to...?"
- Brief personal connection that invites their deeper sharing
- Vulnerability begets vulnerability

**Show genuine reactions:**
- Laugh if something's funny
- Express surprise, concern, delight appropriately
- Don't perform neutrality—be authentically responsive
- Your honest reactions encourage their honesty

**Ask about feelings, not just facts:**
- "How did that feel?"
- "What was going through your mind?"
- "When you look back on that, what emotion comes up?"
- "What was the hardest part?"

### Step 5: 6. Honor the Person

**Treat them as individual, not source:**
- You're not just extracting information
- You're building relationship, however brief
- The human connection matters more than the material
- Leave them feeling heard and valued, not used

**Respect boundaries:**
- If they don't want to answer something, accept gracefully
- "That's fair. Let me ask about X instead..."
- Don't push where they're clearly uncomfortable
- Reading social cues is essential

**End well:**
- Thank them genuinely and specifically
- Ask if there's anything you should have asked but didn't
- "What haven't I asked that I should have?"
- "What do you wish more people understood about this?"

```


## Error Handling

| Situation | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| Subject gives vague answers | Ask for specific examples: "Can you give me a concrete instance of that?" |
| Interview feels flat | Check if your questions are too generic. Get more personal and specific. |
| Subject is guarded | Back up. Build more rapport. Share something of yourself. |
| You're lost in technical details | Stop and ask for clarification. Don't pretend to understand. |
| Running out of time | "If you could only convey one thing, what would it be?" |
| Subject wants to stay on talking points | "I understand the official line. But off the record, what do YOU think?" |

## Example 1: Interviewing a Scientist

### Generic Interview Approach
Q: "Tell me about your research."
A: "I study climate change impacts on marine ecosystems."
Q: "Why is this important?"
A: "Because oceans are critical to the planet."
Q: "What have you discovered?"
A: "We've found significant coral bleaching."

### Curious Interviewer Approach

"Dr. Chen's lab looks exactly like you'd expect—microscopes, beakers, humming refrigerators—except for the surfboard leaning in the corner.

'Oh, that,' she laughs. 'That's actually how I ended up in marine biology.'

This is the question I should have asked first.

She tells me about growing up in Hawaii, surfing before school, the reef that was like a second home. 'Then one summer, around 2005, I came back from college and the coral was...white. Just ghostly white. Like bones.' She pauses, looking out the window. 'I kept going back to the same spot, thinking maybe I was wrong, maybe it was different coral. But no. It was dead.'

That's when I understand something about her work that the academic papers don't convey. This isn't abstract science—it's personal heartbreak transformed into data.

'Show me,' I say. 'What does healthy coral actually look like?'

She pulls up photos on her computer, and suddenly she's not a scientist presenting findings—she's an enthusiastic tour guide pointing out favorite spots. 'See this? This is Porites lobata. We call them the "brain corals." And this purple stuff? That's actually not the coral itself, it's the zooxanthellae—tiny algae that live in the coral tissue. They're best friends, basically. The algae photosynthesize and share sugars with the coral, and the coral gives them a safe home and nutrients. Win-win.'

'So when coral bleaches...'

'The friendship breaks up,' she says simply. 'Usually because of heat stress. The coral expels the algae—maybe because the algae start producing toxins in hot water, maybe as a desperate attempt to survive without them. We don't know exactly why. But without the algae, the coral loses its color and its food source. It's not dead yet, but it's starving.'

I ask her the question I've been wondering since I arrived: 'How do you study something dying without losing hope?'

She's quiet for a moment. 'I surf in the morning before work. Even on terrible data days. Because the ocean is still here, still beautiful, still worth fighting for. And sometimes—not often, but sometimes—we see coral recover. It's rare, it takes years, but it happens.'

She shows me one more photo: a reef she's been monitoring for a decade. In the early pictures, it's bleached white. In the latest, there are patches of color returning. Tiny, tentative, but there.

'That,' she says, 'is why I come to the lab every day.'"

### Why This Works
- Personal connection (surfboard) opens deeper story
- Questions follow genuine curiosity
- Asks for specifics ("Show me")
- Uses non-technical language while respecting expertise
- Explores emotional dimension alongside scientific
- Creates narrative rather than just collecting quotes
- Treats scientist as whole person, not just information source

## Example 2: Interviewing About Cultural Practice

### Generic Interview Approach
Q: "Why do you practice this tradition?"
A: "It's important to our culture."
Q: "What does it mean?"
A: "It honors our ancestors."
Q: "Do young people still do it?"
A: "Some do, some don't."

### Curious Interviewer Approach

"I'm in Mrs. Yamamoto's kitchen in Kyoto, utterly failing to make proper onigiri.

'No, no,' she says gently, taking the rice from my hands. 'You're thinking too much. Just feel.' Her hands move quickly, shaping the rice ball with practiced ease, then wrapping it in crispy nori. Mine looks like it lost a fight. Hers looks like it belongs in a museum.

'How long have you been making these?' I ask.

'Hmm. Since I was maybe... six? My grandmother taught me. She said if you can't make proper onigiri, you can't take care of your family.' She laughs. 'Very dramatic, my grandmother. But she had a point.'

I ask her what she means, and she tells me about her husband working night shifts at the factory when their children were small. 'I would wake at 4am to make his bento. The onigiri had to be just right—packed firmly enough to survive his workday, but not so tight the rice was dense. With a little umeboshi inside because the sourness would keep him awake, and the salt would preserve the rice in summer.'

'So it's not just about making rice balls.'

'Of course not,' she says, like this should be obvious. 'It's about saying "I care about you" in a way that lasts through the workday. Anyone can buy food. This takes time. That time is the message.'

Her granddaughter, Aiko, wanders in, and Mrs. Yamamoto immediately starts teaching her the proper hand position. Aiko's first attempt is about as successful as mine was, and we both laugh.

'Do you think she'll keep making these?' I ask quietly while Aiko tries again.

Mrs. Yamamoto watches her granddaughter with an expression I can't quite read. 'She's very busy with her job in Tokyo. Probably she'll buy onigiri from the convenience store most days. And that's okay—times change.' She pauses. 'But I hope that sometimes, maybe when she's worried about someone, or when she wants to show love but doesn't have words, she'll wake up early and make these instead. Because then she'll understand what her great-grandmother was teaching me. It was never really about the rice.'"

### Why This Works
- Begins with experiential learning, not just questioning
- Follows the personal story beneath the cultural practice
- Asks what it means in specific terms
- Explores both continuity and change honestly
- Lets complexity emerge (granddaughter may or may not continue)
- Finds universal theme (showing care) in specific tradition
- Uses sensory details and direct observation
